# Divyanshu's Stopwatch ⏱️

This is a minimalist, ad-free stopwatch web app I built for **personal use**. It’s not a fancy or groundbreaking project—just a simple tool that helps me stay focused during study sessions without the distractions or clutter found in many timer apps on mobile stores.

### Why I made it

Most apps I tried either came with:
- Annoying ads popping up mid-session
- Unnecessary features I didn’t need
- Or lacked the exact flow I wanted for my daily study tracking

So I built this lightweight web version that:
- Tracks study time minute by minute
- Gives motivational feedback as you progress
- Saves daily history for the last 5 days
- Doesn’t show ads, nags, or lock features

Feel free to use it if it fits your needs. It runs entirely in your browser, works offline, and respects your space.
